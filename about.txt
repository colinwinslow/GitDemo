I like making commits lalalalala make dat graph look cool!

Just adding a random commit

for(x = 0; x < whoaThere.length; x++)
{
  System.out.println("This is something we can do in Github"); 
}

while( flag != false ) 
{ 
  if( x = 0 )
  {
    flag = true; 
  }
  
  else 
  {
    System.out.println("Just some random code!"); 
    flag = false; 
  }
}

//Github is awesome and so is version control!
